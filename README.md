# [Project 1: Classifying Bots on Twitter Using Machine Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/DanielleSanteng/Portfolio/blob/main/Bot%20Detection%20on%20Twitter%20Project.py)

For my master's final project, I used 3 different machine learning algorithms to classify accounts from Twitter into human or bot

* Data was collected using Twitter API
* To label accounts into bots and human, scores were collected from Botometer API and a threshold was set to differentiate between the two types of account
* Data was visualised to understand which variables should be included in each model
* Algortithms used were: Decision Tree, Random Forest and Bag of Words 
* Attempt to further differentiate between 'bad' and 'good' bots as bad bots are ones that should be flagged for removal

# [Project 2: SQL Queries](https://github.com/DanielleSanteng/Portfolio/blob/main/SQL%20Queries.sql)

For this project, complex SQL queries were created to explore a data warehouse to study business intelligence (module name)

* The data warehouse contained data for a made up gaming company 
* Queries were created to support decision makers in the company

# [Project 3: Regression Models](https://github.com/DanielleSanteng/Portfolio/blob/main/Regression%20Models.R)

For this project, the dataset used was from a made up motor insurance company

* Descriptive graphs and tools were made 
* Correlation analysis before building the models
* Linear regression models for both insurance payment amounts and number of claims
